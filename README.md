# [export-ADData](https://github.com/Tatsuya-Nonogaki/export-ADData)

## Overview

export-ADData is a flexible PowerShell toolkit for exporting and importing Active Directory users and groups. Easily convert AD data to CSV and back, with advanced import features for cross-domain migration, OU reorganization, granular mapping, and robust validation. Ideal for admins managing AD at scale.

- **`export-ADData`**: Export Active Directory (AD) users and groups to CSV files with flexible options.
- **`import-ADData`**: Import AD users and groups from CSV files, supporting migration, OU reorganization, cross-domain moves, flattening, and detailed mapping.
- **`compare-ADCSV`**: Compare two AD export CSVs for verification.
- **`check-ADUserPassword`**: Check AD user password validity.

---

## Typical Workflow and Usage Scenarios

The intended usage is to export by specifying the domain basis, so that objects are output without losing their required attributes. If necessary, you are free to edit the exported CSV files, removing any unwanted entries, etc., before using it as input for the import. If you want to register password to any users, add a "Password" column to the User CSV (which is missing from the original), and put the password in plain text. Note that a password is required to restore the "Enabled" flag of the account.

When importing, four major strategies are expected:

1. **Export specifying "DC=domain,DC=local" and import to "DC=domain,DC=local"**  
   This is like backup and restore of AD users/groups. Note, however, that properties automatically generated by AD, such as GUID and SID, will have different values from the export source.

2. **Export specifying "DC=olddomain,DC=local" and import to "DC=newdomain,DC=local"**  
   Allocate the users/groups onto a new domain basis, translating the domain naming, respecting hierarchies.

3. **Export specifying "DC=domain,DC=local" and import to "OU=osaka,DC=domain,DC=local"**  
   Whole migration from the domain basis to a new specific OU, along with all intermediate OUs the users/groups depend on. In this case, users under CN=Users container are created just under OU=osaka because it is impossible to create "Users" container nor OU=Users under the OU. Specifying "newdomain" is also a viable choice, which is like a move to a different floor of a different building.

4. **Export specifying "OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local" and import to "DC=domain,DC=local" with `-TrimOU sales`**  
   Useful for flattening part of the OU hierarchy. By exporting from a specific OU and importing to the domain root with `-TrimOU`, you can migrate only the objects under that OU directly to the root (or another OU), effectively removing their original OU nesting.

### 2. import-ADData.ps1

#### Overview

Imports AD users and groups from CSV files, supporting domain migration, OU reorganization, and advanced mapping features. Automatically creates missing OUs and can handle a wide range of migration scenarios.

#### Key Features

- Import AD Users and Groups from CSV files.
- Optionally include system objects.
- Handle objects in `CN=Users` container specially and appropriately, redirecting them to a designated OU when needed.
- Create missing intermediate OUs during the import.
- Detailed logging of import operations.
- Never overwrite existing Users/Groups. Warn and skip in each case.
- Option to disable "protect from accidental deletion" for newly created OUs, useful for pre-validation etc.
- Supports registering user passwords if provided in the CSV.
- Advanced features for OU trimming and control over Users container placement (`-TrimOU`, `-NoUsersContainer`, `-NoForceUsersContainer`).
- Mode vs file mismatch detection: Warns and prompts if the selected CSV file suggests a mismatch with the chosen import mode (e.g., a group import with a user data file), helping avoid accidental mis-imports. Contents check can be bypassed with `-NoClassCheck` switch for more flexible or advanced import scenarios.

#### Parameters

| Parameter                 | Alias   | Required | Description                                                                                           |

| `-DNPrefix`               | `-d`    | Yes\*    | Alternative to `-DNPath`. Dotted format (e.g., `unit.domain.local`).                                  |
| `-DCDepth`                |         | No       | Depth of DC components in `-DNPrefix` (default: 2).                                                   |
| `-User`                   | `-u`    | No       | Import mode for users. Implied if `-UserFile` specified.                                              |

| `-NoUsersContainer`       |         | No       | Place users/groups with no OU or in Users container directly under the domain root instead of `CN=Users,DC=...`.            |
| `-NoForceUsersContainer`  |         | No       | Import objects as their DN dictates: if the DN is directly under the domain root, import as is; if under Users container, import as is. Mutually exclusive with `-NoUsersContainer`. |

> \*Either `-DNPath` or `-DNPrefix` is required. They are mutually exclusive.

#### Advanced Options

##### -TrimOU

Allows you to remove one or more OUs from the end (domain-root side) of the DistinguishedName of imported objects. The argument must be a comma-separated list of OU names (without the `OU=` prefix).

```powershell
-TrimOU "deeper,sales"
```
This example trims `OU=sales` first, then `OU=deeper`, from the **rightmost** OUs (nearest the domain root) of each DN path, if present.

**Rules:**
- Only plain OU names are allowed. Do not use `OU=` prefix, full DN fragments, or any other prefix.
- Trimming only occurs if the source DN ends with the specified OU sequence (the right-most/nearest to domain root), and the match must be in exact order.
- Trimming never removes `DC`, `CN`, or any components other than OUs.
- The following are reserved words and are **not permitted as OU names in the `-TrimOU` argument**: `ou`, `cn`, `dc`, `users`, `=` (case-insensitive match; `=` is not permitted anywhere in the name).  
  *Note: This is a local rule for this script, not a restriction imposed by Active Directory itself (except for `=`), but it prevents confusion and scripting errors.*
- Empty patterns (e.g., `,,`) are invalid.
- If any invalid name is detected, the script will abort with an error.
- **Note:** When specifying multiple OU names for `-TrimOU`, always enclose the list in quotes (single or double), for example: `-TrimOU "deeper,sales"`. This ensures PowerShell passes the entire list as a single argument.
- **Note:** You should only specify an OU (or sequence of OUs) for `-TrimOU` that all entries have as their rightmost OUs.  
  If you specify OUs that are not present in some entry's DN, only those matching entries will be trimmed. Others will retain their original hierarchy, which can lead to an inconsistent and fragmented OU structure in the imported domain.

**Examples:**

| Exported DN                                        | -TrimOU Argument | Resulting Path After Trim        | Explanation                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OU=deeper,OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local              | sales            | OU=deeper,DC=domain,DC=local     | Match (rightmost OU is "sales"), only "sales" trimmed             |
| OU=deeper,OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local              | deeper           | [ unchanged ]                    | No match (rightmost OU is "sales", not "deeper")                  |
| OU=deeper,OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local              | deeper,sales     | DC=domain,DC=local               | Match (rightmost sequence is "deeper,sales"), both OUs trimmed    |
| OU=foo,OU=bar,OU=deeper,OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local| deeper,sales     | OU=foo,OU=bar,DC=domain,DC=local | Match (rightmost sequence), both OUs trimmed                      |
| OU=foo,OU=bar,OU=deeper,OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local| bar,deeper       | [ unchanged ]                    | No match (rightmost OUs are "deeper,sales")                       |

---

##### -NoUsersContainer and -NoForceUsersContainer

By default, user or group objects imported directly under the domain root (with no OU) are placed in the domain's default container (`CN=Users,DC=...`).  
If you specify `-NoUsersContainer`, such objects are instead created directly under the domain root (`DC=...`).  
If you specify `-NoForceUsersContainer`, objects are imported exactly as their DN dictates:  
- If the DN was originally directly under the domain root, it is imported there.
- If the DN was originally under the Users container, it remains in Users.

**Precautions:**
- These parameters are **mutually exclusive**; you must specify only one or neither.
- Placing users or groups directly under the domain root is valid but not recommended for most environments.
- Use these options only if you are sure this is what you want.

---

#### Password Handling and Account Enablement

If you want to set a password for any users, add a `"Password"` column to the User CSV (not present in the original export) and put the password in plain text.  
**Do note password is required to restore the "Enabled" flag of the account during import.**  
If password is absent for a user, the account will be created but remain disabled.

---

#### Usage Examples

```powershell
# Import AD Groups from CSV to a new domain, excluding system objects
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=newdomain,DC=local" -GroupFile ".\Groups_olddomain_local.csv"

# Import AD Users from CSV to an OU on a domain, using a file dialog
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "OU=osaka,DC=newdomain,DC=local" -User
# NOTE: You must create the **base** OU "osaka" in the destination AD before running the import, if it does not already exist.

# Import AD Users and Groups, using default (safe) policy: OU objects without OU go onto CN=Users
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=domain,DC=local" -UserFile "Users.csv" -GroupFile "Groups.csv"

# Import users, trimming two rightmost OUs and placing directly under domain root (not in CN=Users)
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=domain,DC=local" -UserFile "Users_deeper_sales_domain_local.csv" -TrimOU "deeper,sales" -NoUsersContainer

# Import users, preserving DN structure (Users container or domain root) as-is
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=domain,DC=local" -UserFile "Users.csv" -NoForceUsersContainer
```

#### Best Practices and Safety Tips

- Always verify the target DNPath and perform a test import before running in production.
- Use `-NoUsersContainer` with caution; placing users or groups directly under the domain root can cause confusion in large AD environments. Many AD tools and scripts—including some Microsoft tools—do not expect or properly handle such objects.
- Some group-to-group memberships may fail to register during bulk group import due to the order of records in the CSV. In such cases, manual intervention may be required (e.g., remove the failed groups and rerun the import using the same CSV).

### 3. compare-ADCSV.ps1

#### Overview

Compares two CSV exports of AD users or groups, helping you verify changes, migrations, or synchronization.

#### Key Features

- Compare two CSV files of AD users or groups.
- Comparison is done with sAMAccountName as the key, without being affected by the order of records in the CSV file, unlike ordinary "diff" tools.
- Detects and outputs records where there is a difference in DistinguishedName, MemberOf, or when an entry is present only on one side.
- For user CSVs, differences in `Enabled` and `PasswordNeverExpires` are also checked and reported, but these fields are considered auxiliary and do not affect the main inclusion criteria.
- Optionally, you can include entries with no detected differences in the output (`-IncludeEqual` switch).
- Output is written to a CSV file or shown in the PowerShell console.

#### Parameters

| Parameter         | Alias | Required | Description                                      |
|-------------------|-------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `-OldFile`        | `-o`  | Yes      | Old CSV file (source)                            |
| `-NewFile`        | `-n`  | Yes      | New CSV file (destination)                       |
| `-OutFile`        |       | No       | Output CSV file for results                      |
| `-IncludeEqual`   |       | No       | Include entries with no detected difference      |

#### Usage Examples

```powershell
# Compare two user CSVs and output differences to a file
.\compare-ADCSV.ps1 -OldFile "oldusers.csv" -NewFile "newusers.csv" -OutFile "diff.csv"

# Compare groups, show all entries (including identical)
.\compare-ADCSV.ps1 -OldFile "oldgroups.csv" -NewFile "newgroups.csv" -IncludeEqual
```
