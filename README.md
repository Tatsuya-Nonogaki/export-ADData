## Typical Workflow and Usage Scenarios

The basic usage is to export Active Directory objects by specifying the domain root or OU you wish to target. You are free to edit the exported CSV files—removing unwanted entries or making modifications—before using them as input for the import process. To assign passwords to users, add a "Password" column to the User CSV (this column is not present in the original export) and enter the desired passwords in plain text. Note that setting a password is required to properly restore the "Enabled" status of user accounts during import.

> 📝 **Note:**  
> You can also perform a **mass registration from scratch** by first preparing CSV templates—simply export data from any sample Active Directory environment to generate the CSV structure, then edit these files as needed. The name of the source domain does not matter, as the importer (`import-ADData.ps1`) can convert and map the objects to your new domain automatically.  

> 💡 **Tips:**
> Step-by-step guide to export and edit CSV files for successful imports is provided in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder:
> - [HOWTO_prepare_CSV_data.md](docs/HOWTO_prepare_CSV_data.md) `(GitHub Web) /` [*(GitHub Pages HTML)*](https://tatsuya-nonogaki.github.io/export-ADData/docs/HOWTO_prepare_CSV_data.html)
> - [HOWTO_prepare_CSV_data_ja.md](docs/HOWTO_prepare_CSV_data_ja.md) `(GitHub Web) /` [*(GitHub Pages HTML)*](https://tatsuya-nonogaki.github.io/export-ADData/docs/HOWTO_prepare_CSV_data_ja.html)

There are four major strategies for combining export and import:

1. **Export specifying "DC=domain,DC=local" and import to "DC=domain,DC=local"**  
   This is like backup and restore of AD users/groups. Note, however, that properties automatically generated by AD, such as GUID and SID, will have different values from the export source.

2. **Export specifying "DC=olddomain,DC=local" and import to "DC=newdomain,DC=local"**  
   Allocate the users/groups onto a new domain basis, translating the domain naming, respecting hierarchies.

3. **Export specifying "DC=domain,DC=local" and import to "OU=osaka,DC=domain,DC=local"**  
   Whole migration from the domain basis to a new specific OU, along with all intermediate OUs the users/groups depend on. In this case, users under CN=Users container are created just under OU=osaka because it is impossible to create `Users` container nor OU=Users under the OU. Specifying "newdomain" is also a viable choice, which is like a move to a different floor of a different building.

4. **Export specifying "OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local" and import to "DC=domain,DC=local" with `-TrimOU sales`**  
   Useful for flattening part of the OU hierarchy. By exporting from a specific OU and importing to the domain root with `-TrimOU`, you can migrate only the objects under that OU directly to the root (or another OU), effectively removing their original OU nesting.

> More advanced use is possible. For example, if you export from "OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local", and import into "OU=marketing,DC=domain,DC=local" with `-TrimOU "sales"` option, you can effectively move objects from the "sales" OU to the "marketing" OU in a two-step process—without manually editing every DN in the exported CSV data.

### 2. import-ADData.ps1

#### Overview

Imports AD users, groups, and computers from CSV files, supporting domain migration, OU reorganization, and advanced mapping features. Automatically creates missing OUs and can handle a wide range of migration scenarios.

#### Key Features

- Import AD Users, Groups, and Computers from CSV files (`-User`, `-Group` and `-Computer` mode).
- Register `ManagedBy` attribute for Groups separately in a dedicated run (`-FixGroup` mode).
- Optionally include system objects.
- Handle objects in "Default" container (`CN=Users`, `CN=Computers`) specially and appropriately, redirecting them to a designated OU when needed.
- Create missing intermediate OUs during the import.
- Detailed logging of import operations.
- Never overwrite existing Users/Groups. Warn and skip in each case.
- Option to disable "protect from accidental deletion" for newly created OUs, useful for pre-validation etc.
- Supports registering user passwords if provided in the CSV.
- Advanced features for OU trimming and control over "Default" container placement (`-TrimOU`, `-NoDefaultContainer`, `-NoForceDefaultContainer`).
- Mode vs file mismatch detection: By default, the script checks both the file name and the `ObjectClass` column in your CSV file to ensure it matches the selected import mode (user, group, or computer). If a mismatch is detected, you are warned before import begins. The `-NoClassCheck` switch disables only the check on the `ObjectClass` column; filename check is always enabled.

#### Parameters

| Parameter                 | Alias   | Required | Description                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|---------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-DNPath`                 | `-p`    | Yes\*    | Target base DN for import (e.g., `DC=newdomain,DC=local` or `OU=sales,DC=newdomain,DC=local`). **The base DN object (OU or domain root) must already exist; this script does NOT create the base OU.**  |
| `-DNPrefix`               | `-d`    | Yes\*    | Alternative to `-DNPath`. Dotted format (e.g., `unit.domain.local`).                                  |
| `-DCDepth`                |         | No       | Depth of DC components in `-DNPrefix` (default: 2).                                                   |
| `-User`                   | `-u`    | No       | Import mode for users. Implied if `-UserFile` specified.                                              |
| `-UserFile`               | `-uf`   | No       | Path to user CSV file. Dialog prompts if omitted and `-User` is set.                                  |
| `-Group`                  | `-g`    | No       | Import mode for groups. Implied if `-GroupFile` specified.                                            |
| `-GroupFile`              | `-gf`   | No       | Path to group CSV file. Dialog prompts if omitted and `-Group` is set.                                |
| `-Computer`               | `-c`    | No       | Import mode for computers. Implied if `-ComputerFile` specified.                                      |
| `-ComputerFile`           | `-cf`   | No       | Path to computer CSV file. Dialog prompts if omitted and `-Computer` is set.                          |
| `-FixGroup`               |         | No       | Operates in a post-import fixup mode for existing groups. Run after user and group imports. This sets `ManagedBy` references that require prior import of users/groups. See note below. |
| `-NoClassCheck`           |         | No       | By default, this script checks that all records in the input file have an `ObjectClass` matching the selected import mode (user, group, or computer). This switch disables the `ObjectClass` column check, allowing you to import files that are missing the column or contain mixed/incorrect types. Filename-based mode checks are always performed. Only use this if you know what you are doing. |
| `-IncludeSystemObject`    |         | No       | Import critical system users/groups (normally dangerous).                                             |
| `-NewUPNSuffix`           |         | No       | New suffix for UserPrincipalName. Defaults to value derived from `-DNPath`.                           |
| `-NoProtectNewOU`         |         | No       | Newly created OUs will not be protected from accidental deletion.                                     |
| `-TrimOU`                 |         | No       | Remove one or more rightmost (nearest the domain root) OUs from source DNs before import.             |
| `-NoDefaultContainer`     |         | No       | Place users/groups/computers with no OU or in "Default" container, i.e., `CN=Users` or `CN=Computers`, directly under the domain root. |
| `-NoForceDefaultContainer` |         | No       | Import objects as their DN dictates: if the DN is directly under the domain root, import as is; if under default container e.g., `CN=Users,DC=...`, import as is. Mutually exclusive with `-NoDefaultContainer`. |

> \*Either `-DNPath` or `-DNPrefix` is required. They are mutually exclusive.

##### Note about `-FixGroup` mode

`-FixGroup` enables a special post-import operation to set the `ManagedBy` property on groups, using the same GroupFile as in the import step. This is necessary because `ManagedBy` typically references user objects, which must already exist in the target AD. This mode does not create or remove any groups or users—it only updates the `ManagedBy` property for existing groups, mapping references according to the `-DNPath`, and advanced options (such as `-TrimOU`, `-NoDefaultContainer`, etc.).

- `-FixGroup` is mutually exclusive with user/group import modes.
- Requires a valid `-GroupFile` (prompted if omitted).
- Use the same `DNPath` (and advanced options if applicable) as your prior imports for correct results.
- For best results, run after all user and group objects are imported.

---

#### Advanced Options

##### -TrimOU

Allows you to remove one or more OUs from the end (domain-root side) of the DistinguishedName of objects to be imported. The argument must be a comma-separated list of OU names (without the `OU=` prefix).

```powershell
-TrimOU "deeper,sales"
```
This example trims `OU=sales` first, then `OU=deeper`, from the **rightmost** OUs (nearest the domain root) of each DN path, if present.

**Rules:**
- Only plain OU names are allowed. Do not use `OU=` prefix, full DN fragments, or any other prefix.
- Trimming only occurs if the source DN ends with the specified OU sequence (the right-most/nearest to domain root), and the match must be in exact order.
- Trimming never removes `DC`, `CN`, or any components other than OUs.
- The following are reserved words and are **not permitted as OU names in the `-TrimOU` argument**: `ou`, `cn`, `dc`, `users`, `computers`, `=` (case-insensitive match; `=` is not permitted anywhere in the name).  
  📝 *This is a local rule for this script, not a restriction imposed by Active Directory itself (except for `=`), but it prevents confusion and scripting errors.*
- Empty patterns (e.g., `,,`) are invalid.
- If any invalid name is detected, the script will abort with an error.
- 📝 **Note:** When specifying multiple OU names for `-TrimOU`, always enclose the list in quotes (single or double), for example: `-TrimOU "deeper,sales"`. This ensures PowerShell passes the entire list as a single argument.
- 📝 **Note:** You should only specify an OU (or sequence of OUs) for `-TrimOU` that all entries have as their rightmost OUs.  
  If you specify OUs that are not present in some entry's DN, only those matching entries will be trimmed. Others will retain their original hierarchy, which can lead to an inconsistent and fragmented OU structure in the imported domain.

**Examples:**

| Exported DN                                        | -TrimOU Argument | Resulting Path After Trim        | Explanation                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OU=deeper,OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local              | sales            | OU=deeper,DC=domain,DC=local     | Match (rightmost OU is "sales"), only "sales" trimmed             |
| OU=deeper,OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local              | deeper           | [ unchanged ]                    | No match (rightmost OU is "sales", not "deeper")                  |
| OU=deeper,OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local              | deeper,sales     | DC=domain,DC=local               | Match (rightmost sequence is "deeper,sales"), both OUs trimmed    |
| OU=foo,OU=bar,OU=deeper,OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local| deeper,sales     | OU=foo,OU=bar,DC=domain,DC=local | Match (rightmost sequence), both OUs trimmed                      |
| OU=foo,OU=bar,OU=deeper,OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local| bar,deeper       | [ unchanged ]                    | No match (rightmost OUs are "deeper,sales")                       |

---

##### -NoDefaultContainer and -NoForceDefaultContainer

By default, users, groups, and computers that would otherwise be created directly under the domain root are placed in the domain's "Default" container (`CN=Users,DC=...` for users and groups, `CN=Computers` for computers).  
If you specify `-NoDefaultContainer`, such objects are instead created directly under the domain root (`DC=...`).  
If you specify `-NoForceDefaultContainer`, objects are imported exactly as their DN dictates:  
- If the DN was originally directly under the domain root, it is imported there.
- If the DN was originally under the default container, it remains in it.

This behavior also applies in cases where the resulting DN path ends up directly under the domain root, such as when all OUs are removed from an object's original DN by the `-TrimOU` option.

**Precautions:**
- These parameters are **mutually exclusive**; you must specify only one or neither.
- Placing users, groups, or computers directly under the domain root is valid but not recommended for most environments.
- Use these options only if you are sure this is what you want.

---

##### Password Handling, Account Enablement, and ChangePasswordAtLogon

To set a password for users during import, add a `"Password"` column to your User CSV (this column is not present in the original export) and enter the desired password in plain text.

**Password is required to `Enable` an account during import.**  
If the password is absent for a user, the account will be created but remain disabled.

##### Controlling the "User must change password at next logon" flag

You have two options to control the "User must change password at next logon" (`ChangePasswordAtLogon`) setting for users to be imported:

- **Via a dedicated CSV column:**  
  Add a `"ChangePasswordAtLogon"` column to your User CSV.  
  - If you set this column to a **positive value** (`TRUE`, `YES`, or `1`, case-insensitive), the flag will be explicitly set (user must change password at next logon).  
  - If set to a **negative value** (`FALSE`, `NO`, or `0`), the flag will be explicitly cleared.
  - **When setting this to POSITIVE VALUE a password is required in the `"Password"` column for that user.**
  - When setting it to a negative value, the flag will be cleared regardless of whether a password is set, as Active Directory does not prohibit this operation.

- **Via userAccountControl bit (legacy/fallback):**  
  If the `"ChangePasswordAtLogon"` column is not present or is blank for a user, the script will honor the `0x80000` bit in the `userAccountControl` column, **if set**, provided a password is also present. If both the `0x80000` bit and the `"ChangePasswordAtLogon"` column are either absent or indicate a negative value, the script **does not clear** the "User must change password at next logon" flag; instead, the default password policy of the destination AD will apply.

**Golden rule:**  
The `"ChangePasswordAtLogon"` column, if present and non-blank, takes precedence over the userAccountControl bit.

**Summary Table:**

| ChangePasswordAtLogon (column) | Password Set | Action                                                     |
|--------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| TRUE/YES/1                     | Yes          | Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true                    |
| FALSE/NO/0                     | Yes          | Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $false                   |
| TRUE/YES/1                     | No           | Warn, do not set                                           |
| FALSE/NO/0                     | No           | Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $false (this is allowed) |
| blank/missing                  | Yes          | userAccountControl bit `0x80000` → set flag if present     |
| blank/missing                  | No           | userAccountControl bit `0x80000` → warn, do not set        |

##### ManagedBy Property: Mapping and Container Handling

When importing or registering the `ManagedBy` property, especially with advanced options or when targeting default containers, the destination OU or container for the referenced object may not match your expectations due to mapping rules and option interactions (such as `-TrimOU` or `-NoDefaultContainer`).  
**A common issue** is that the Distinguished Name (DN) in the `ManagedBy` field of the source CSV may not correspond to the DN of any imported user or group in the target AD. For example, if a computer object is imported into `OU=sales,DC=domain,DC=local`, but its `ManagedBy` value in the source CSV is directly on the domain-root (DC=domain,DC=local). The registration will fail unless a user with that exact DN exists in the destination AD.  

> 📝 **Note:** It is also impossible to register `ManagedBy` if it refers to a `Contact` object, which is currently out of scope for this script.

If you encounter unexpected placements or registration failures, review your DN mapping and advanced parameters.  
You may need to adjust specific CSV records (for example, update the `ManagedBy` DN to match the actual imported user's DN), or hand register the `ManagedBy` property after import to achieve the intended outcome.

---

##### GroupCategory and GroupScope handling in Group Imports

These properties are normally sourced from the `groupType` column. However, recalculating the hexadecimal integer for `groupType` can be cumbersome when modifications are required.  
To simplify this process, you may leave `groupType` blank or prefix its value with a hash ("#"). In these cases, the script will use the string columns `GroupCategory` and `GroupScope` instead.

---

#### Usage Examples

```powershell
# Import AD Groups from CSV to a new domain, excluding system objects
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=newdomain,DC=local" -GroupFile ".\Groups_olddomain_local.csv"

# Import AD Users from CSV to an OU on a domain, using a file dialog
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "OU=osaka,DC=newdomain,DC=local" -User
# NOTE: You must create the **base** OU "osaka" in the destination AD before running the import, if it does not already exist.

# Import AD Computers from CSV
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=domain,DC=local" -ComputerFile "C:\Exp\Computers_olddomain_local.csv"

# Import users, trimming two rightmost OUs and placing directly under domain root (not in CN=Users)
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=domain,DC=local" -UserFile "Users_deeper_sales_domain_local.csv" -TrimOU "deeper,sales" -NoDefaultContainer

# Import users, preserving DN structure (Users container or domain root) as-is
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=domain,DC=local" -UserFile "Users.csv" -NoForceDefaultContainer
```

##### Registering ManagedBy for Groups after User/Group Import

To set the `ManagedBy` property for groups after importing users and groups, run the following sequence. Be sure to use the same `-DNPath` and advanced options (such as `-TrimOU`, `-NoDefaultContainer`, etc.) for all runs to ensure DN mapping is consistent.

```powershell
# Import groups
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=newdomain,DC=local" -GroupFile ".\Groups_olddomain_local.csv"

# Import users
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=newdomain,DC=local" -UserFile ".\Users_olddomain_local.csv"

# Register ManagedBy for groups using FixGroup mode
.\import-ADData.ps1 -DNPath "DC=newdomain,DC=local" -FixGroup -GroupFile ".\Groups_olddomain_local.csv"
```

#### Best Practices and Safety Tips

- Always verify the target DNPath and perform a test import before running in production.
- Use `-NoDefaultContainer` with caution; placing users or groups directly under the domain root can cause confusion in large AD environments. Many AD tools and scripts—including some Microsoft tools—do not expect or properly handle such objects.
- Some group-to-group memberships may fail to register during bulk group import due to the order of records in the CSV. In such cases, manual intervention may be required (e.g., remove the failed groups and rerun the import using the same CSV).

### 3. compare-ADCSV.ps1

#### Overview

Compares two CSV exports of AD users, groups or computers, helping you verify changes, migrations, or synchronization.

#### Key Features

- Compare two CSV files of AD users, groups, or computers.
- Comparison is done with sAMAccountName as the key, without being affected by the order of records in the CSV file, unlike ordinary "diff" tools.
- Detects and outputs records where there is a difference in DistinguishedName, MemberOf, or when an entry is present only on one side.
- For user CSVs, differences in `Enabled` and `PasswordNeverExpires` are also checked and reported, but these fields are considered auxiliary and do not affect the main inclusion criteria.
- Optionally, you can include entries with no detected differences in the output (`-IncludeEqual` switch).
- Output is written to a CSV file or shown in the PowerShell console.

#### Parameters
